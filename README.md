# Sensitivity-Analysis---Whole-Life-Insurance-
A Sensitivity Analysis of Interest Rate vs EPV of two Whole Life Insurance products(conducted in RStudio)

A sensitivity analysis of two insurance products: a whole life annuity payable in 
arrears and a whole life assurance. The goal of this project is to compare how 
sensitive these two products are to interest rate changes by comparing their 
Expected Present Values(EPVs) for three ages (0, 30 and 60) and interest rates
0% to 50%.

The included "mortality_table.txt" file contains a mortality table which shows the
number of people expected to be alive out of 1000 people born, using past mortality
rate data. This is used as the basis to conduct the sensitivity analysis.

The included "sensitivity_analysis_output.txt" file contains a table with the
Standardised EPVs of the different insurance products being compared.
